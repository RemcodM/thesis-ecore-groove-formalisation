    abstract = {Currently, {GROOVE} is capable of importing and exporting {Ecore} models, which can be used by tools such as {Eclipse} using its underlying modeling framework. This is done using a standalone tool which can transform {GROOVE} graphs to {Ecore} models and vice versa. An {Ecore} type model may be imported as a type graph, and {Ecore} instance models as instance graphs. {GROOVE} can then be used to transform these instance graphs, which may then be exported back again to {Ecore} instance models. However, the generated type and instance graphs can sometimes become too complex and unmanageable, where a simpler graph would be sufficient. It is therefore desirable to improve the current import and export facilities, and give the user the option to generate more simple graphs. Ideally, this process would be configurable so different choices can be made on the resulting outcome. Additionally, it is interesting to add the capability for translating other graph languages to the import and export facilities as well, so as to make {GROOVE} more interoperable with other tools.
    
    These problems are addressed by defining a conceptual model, which acts as an intermediate layer between {GROOVE} and possible external languages, such as {Ecore}. A formal description is given for this conceptual model, providing a well defined foundation for the mappings between itself, the external languages and {GROOVE}. The mapping between the conceptual model and the external languages is kept simple by combining the concepts found in these external languages into the conceptual model. Then, only the mapping between {GROOVE} and the conceptual model needs to perform the more heavyweight translation from the conceptual model to the graphs supported by {GROOVE}.

@inproceedings{kleppe_uml-graph-semantics,
    title = "On a {Graph-Based Semantics for UML Class and Object Diagrams}",
    abstract = "In this paper we propose a formal extension of type graphs with notions that are commonplace in the {UML} and have long proven their worth in that context: namely, inheritance, multiplicity, containment and the like. We believe the absence of a comprehensive and commonly agreed upon formalisation of these notions to be an important and, unfortunately, often ignored omission. Since our eventual aim (shared by many researchers) is to give unambiguous, formal semantics to the {UML} using the theory of graphs and graph transformation, in this paper we propose a set of definitions to repair this omission. With respect to previous work in this direction, our aim is to arrive at more comprehensive and at the same time simpler definitions.",

    abstract="Despite the wide range of existing tool support, constructing a design environment for a complex domain-specific language (DSL) is still a tedious task as the large number of derived features and well-formedness constraints complementing the domain metamodel necessitate special handling. Such derived features and constraints are frequently defined by declarative techniques (such graph patterns or OCL invariants). However, for complex domains, derived features and constraints can easily be formalized incorrectly resulting in inconsistent, incomplete or ambiguous DSL specifications. To detect such issues, we propose an automated mapping of EMF metamodels enriched with derived features and well-formedness constraints captured as graph queries in EMF-IncQuery or (a subset of) OCL invariants into an effectively propositional fragment of first-order logic which can be efficiently analyzed by back-end reasoners. On the conceptual level, the main added value of our encoding is (1) to transform graph patterns of the EMF-IncQuery framework into FOL and (2) to introduce approximations for complex language features (e.g., transitive closure or multiplicities) which are not expressible in FOL. On the practical level, we identify and address relevant challenges and scenarios for systematically validating DSL specifications. Our approach is supported by a tool, and it will be illustrated on analyzing a DSL in the avionics domain. We also present initial performance experiments for the validation using Z3 and Alloy as back-end reasoners.",
