## Ecore models

This directory contains some of the Ecore models used within this thesis. They were mostly used as a means to generate images.

All images were exported to SVG first using Eclipse. Then the `ecore-svg-convert` utility within the `util/` folder of this repository was used to convert the SVG images to PDFs for use within LaTeX.

The files ending in `.ecore` are type models.
The files encoding in `.xmi` are instance models.

### Files

- `Chapter5.ecore` and `Chapter5.xmi` are the example models used in the example application of chapter 5 of the thesis.
- `Presentation.ecore` and `Presentation.xmi` are the example models used within the presentation.
- The `Chat*` files contain a simple chat example.
